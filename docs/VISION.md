## What NeverDry is for

**Get running immediately with what you already have.**
NeverDry integrates into an existing Home Assistant setup without requiring new hardware. If you have a temperature sensor and a rain gauge, you can start today. Every additional sensor — weather station, soil moisture probe, flow meter — improves the model; none of them are prerequisites.

**Deliver exactly the water the soil needs — no more, no less.**
The system computes the cumulative soil water deficit and closes valves the moment that deficit is repaid. Plants receive what they need to thrive; excess water is never delivered. Conservation and health are the same goal.

**Make every irrigation decision visible and auditable.**
The system is never silent. Every action — irrigate, skip, postpone, abort — is logged and surfaced in the Home Assistant dashboard. If the garden was not watered, there is a reason, and that reason is readable. Invisible failures are not acceptable.

**Give the user complete freedom of control.**
Manual override, time-based schedule, and fully automatic deficit-driven mode coexist and can be combined zone by zone. Switching modes does not reset the water-balance model or erase history. The user is never forced into a single operating mode; the system adapts to how they want to interact with it on any given day.

**Act at the right moment, driven by plant biology — not by a clock.**
Irrigation happens when the soil deficit crosses the threshold the user has set, accounting for local climate, sun exposure, and plant type. There is no arbitrary fixed-time watering. The system reasons about when water is actually needed and acts accordingly.

**Notify immediately when a valve cannot be commanded.**
If a valve does not respond to an open or close command after the configured number of retries, the system raises a persistent notification and flags the zone as degraded. A stuck-open valve wastes water and can flood plants; a stuck-closed valve means the garden goes unwatered. Neither failure is acceptable silently. The user is always informed so they can act.

## What this means in practice

| Principle | Consequence for design |
|---|---|
| Instant adoption | Zero required sensors beyond a temperature source; progressive enhancement only |
| Precision delivery | Deficit-based volume calculation; no fixed-duration watering without a model reason |
| Visible operation | All decisions logged; activity log downloadable; diagnostic button in UI |
| Freedom of control | Manual / scheduled / automatic modes composable, not mutually exclusive |
| Right moment | Deficit threshold triggers action; no cron-style fixed-time watering as default |
| Valve safety | Retry on command failure; persistent notification + zone degraded flag if unresolved |
